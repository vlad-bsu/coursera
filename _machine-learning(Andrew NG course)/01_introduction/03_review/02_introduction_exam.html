 Question 1
</h3>
<co-content>
 <p>
  A computer program is said to learn from experience E with
 </p>
 <p>
  respect to some task T and some performance measure P if its
 </p>
 <p>
  performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suppose we feed a learning algorithm a lot of historical weather
 </p>
 <p>
  data, and have it learn to predict weather. What would be a
 </p>
 <p>
  reasonable choice for P?
