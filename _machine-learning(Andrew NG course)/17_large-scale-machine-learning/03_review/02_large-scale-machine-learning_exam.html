 Question 1
</h3>
<co-content>
 <p hasmath="true">
  Suppose you are training a logistic regression classifier using stochastic gradient descent. You find that the cost (say, $$cost(\theta,(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}))$$, averaged over the last 500 examples), plotted as a function of the number of iterations, is slowly increasing over time.  Which of the following changes are likely to help?

    Try averaging the cost over a larger number of examples (say 1000 examples instead of 500) in the plot.

    In order to make sure stochastic gradient descent is converging, we typically compute $$J_{\rm train}(\theta)$$ after each iteration (and plot it) in order to make sure that the cost function is generally decreasing.

    One of the advantages of stochastic gradient descent is that it uses parallelization and thus runs much faster than batch gradient descent.

    One of the disadvantages of online learning is that it requires a large amount of computer memory/disk space to store all the training examples we have seen.

    In the approach to online learning discussed in the lecture video, we repeatedly get a single training example, take one step of stochastic gradient descent using that example, and then move on to the next example.

    When using online learning, in each step we get a new example $$(x,y)$$, perform one step of (essentially stochastic gradient descent) learning on that example, and then discard that example and move on to the next.

   <span>
    In order to parallelize a learning algorithm using map-reduce, the first step is to figure out how to express the main work done by the algorithm as computing sums of functions of training examples.

    When using map-reduce with gradient descent, we usually use a single machine that accumulates the gradients from each of the map-reduce machines, in order to compute the parameter update for that iteration.
