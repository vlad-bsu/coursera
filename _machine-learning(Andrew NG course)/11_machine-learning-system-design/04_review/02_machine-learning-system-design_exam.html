 Question 1
</h3>
<co-content>
 <p>
  You are working on a spam classification system using regularized logistic regression. "Spam" is a positive class (y = 1) and "not spam" is the negative class (y = 0). You have trained your classifier and there are m = 1000 examples in the cross-validation set. The chart of predicted class vs. actual class is:

 Question 4

 <p>
  Suppose you are working on a spam classifier, where spam

 <p hasmath="true">
  emails are positive examples ($$y=1$$) and non-spam emails are
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  negative examples ($$y=0$$). You have a training set of emails

    If you always predict non-spam (output

    The "error analysis" process of manually
   </span>
   <span>
    examining the examples which your algorithm got wrong
   </span>
   <span>
    can help suggest what are good steps to take (e.g.,

   <span>
    After training a logistic regression

    classifier, you

     must
