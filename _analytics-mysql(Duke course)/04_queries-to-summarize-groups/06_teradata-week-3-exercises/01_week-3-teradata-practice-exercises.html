    The Teradata exercises for this week assume that you have completed all of the MySQL exercises, and know how to use GROUP BY, HAVING, and JOIN clauses.

   <p>
    The quiz for this week will build off of the Week 3 Teradata exercises, so although you will have hints to the answers, you will not be given the answers explicitly.  If you can complete all the exercises, you will do very well on the quiz.  Save the queries you write during the exercises either in your Teradata account or in a text file on your computer so that you can use them for reference during the quiz.   
 
  Please note that queries that join tables take much longer than those that donâ€™t, so many of the exercises you complete this week (including those required to answer quiz questions) may take much longer to complete than those you completed last week.  You will want to plan accordingly when you are ready to take the quiz.
