  In an effort to save resources, we have set up the Jupyter spaces so that they expire after 6 months, or when they have not been used for 3 months (whichever comes first).
 </p>
 <p>
  In order to refer to the work you have done in your notebooks at a later time outside of the Jupyter environment, after your account has expired, we suggest that
you save your notebooks as PDFs.  To do this, please follow the instructions below (be aware that some of the details
might differ according to your browser or printer set-up):
 </p>
 <p>
  Step 1: Open a Jupyter notebook in the Jupyter environment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Step 2: In the upper left-hand corner, choose File &gt;  Print Preview.  A printable
version of the notebook should appear in a new tab or window.
 </p>
 <p>
  Step 3: Use your computer's print options to print the document in that tab or window to a PDF (in other words, to save the document as a PDF).  The exact
steps will differ on different computers, but they
usually require going to the “File” menu, choosing “Print," and then choosing
the “Print to PDF” option.  Be sure to
name the document with a title you can recognize, and be sure to save it to a
place on your computer where you can find it later.
 </p>

  <u>
   NOTE: in the Jupyter File menu you may see the option "Download as..." but the download as pdf option is not working at the moment!
