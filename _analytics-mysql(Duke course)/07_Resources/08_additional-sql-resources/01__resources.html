  Resources and notes provided by Dr. Jana Schaich Borg, Duke University
 </p>
 <p>
  Many of you have asked for recommendations of other SQL books or resources you could use to continue practicing SQL. Below, I have provided some resources that I found to be particularly helpful.

    SQL in 10 Minutes, Sams Teach Yourself by Ben Forta https://www.amazon.com/SQL-Minutes-Sams-Teach-Yourself/dp/0672336073
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  This book will review all the information you learned in this course, and provide some extra information about the commands one uses to create a database. I find the writing to be very clear and concise.

   <p>
    SQL Database for Beginners by Martin Holzke with Tom Stachowitz https://www.amazon.com/SQL-Database-Beginners-Martin-Holzke/dp/099040207X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1470318766&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=SQL+Database+for+Beginners
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  This book is also very clearly written, but provides much more background and detail than “SQL in 10 minutes.”

    MySQL Cookbook by Paul DuBois https://www.amazon.com/MySQL-Cookbook-Solutions-Developers-Administrators/dp/1449374026/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  This is a book for intermediate to advanced users, because it assumes a lot of working knowledge of SQL and often doesn’t explain the logic behind the solutions in provides. That said, it provides very useful “recipes” for how to solve common problems you might encounter, which has saved me time on multiple occasions.

    Database Systems: Introduction to Databases and Data Warehouses by Nenad Jukić, Susan Vrbsky, and Svetlozar Nestorov. https://www.amazon.com/Database-Systems-Introduction-Databases-Warehouses/dp/0132575671/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1470319426&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Database+Systems%3A+Introduction+to+Databases+and+Data+Warehouses

 <p>
  This is the textbook I referenced in the first weeks of the course. It is more expensive than the other books I’ve listed, but I still find it to be one of the most accessible descriptions I’ve read of how to design databases. I know that Dr. Jukić and his co-authors are working on ways to reduce the cost of the book, so keep an eye out for price drops, and consider buying a used version!

   <u>
    Practice
More SQL
   </u>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  When I was learning SQL, I found it
difficult to find one set of resources that would allow me to learn SQL
efficiently and holistically.  Further, I
lost a lot of time troubleshooting my own desktop version of MySQL.  I designed this course the way I did to
prevent other people from having to go through the same frustration I did
cobbling together a comprehensive learning experience.  At present, I do not know of any other freely-available
resource that allows students to practice SQL the way you have been able to in
this course.  Of course, new resources
are popping up every day, so please let me know if there are any helpful
websites I should make other students aware of!
 </p>
 <p>
  In the meantime, here are at least two
ways you can practice more SQL queries.
 </p>
 <ol bullettype="numbers">
  <li>
   <p>
    Download your own
version of MySQL to your desktop (
    <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/installing.html">
     http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/installing.html
    </a>
    ) and either make your own database (using commands
you can find online, but that we did not review in this course), or download a
free one.  There are many free SQL
databases available online, but here are a couple websites to get you
started:
