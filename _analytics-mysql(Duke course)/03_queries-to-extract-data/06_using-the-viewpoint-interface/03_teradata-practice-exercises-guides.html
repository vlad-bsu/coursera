  Hopefully you enjoyed learning to write your own queries through the Jupyter interface that allowed you to analyze Dognition’s data! With that practice under your belt, you are ready to try writing queries more independently. The weekly “Teradata Exercise Guides,” in combination with the weekly quizzes, will guide you through how to do that using the SQL Scratchpad in Teradata’s Viewpoint online user interface.

  **It is important that you work through the Teradata exercises for this week
  <strong>
   before
  </strong>
  you attempt the graded quiz. The exercises offer instructions that will guide you through problems very similar to those you will encounter in the graded quiz.
  <strong>
   As you work through the Teradata exercises, save your queries.
  </strong>
  You will be able to use modified versions of these queries in the graded quiz.
