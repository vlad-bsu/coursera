  The reason you are learning SQL is to be able to retrieve data you need
to analyze from a database without having to ask somebody else in your company
to do it for you.  Sometimes you will be
making the judgment about what data are important to retrieve, while other
times your team members or bosses will tell you what data they want you to
retrieve.
 </p>
 <p>
  In either case, you will need
to be able to sit in front of a blank query screen and somehow get the data you
intend.  That experience, emotionally,
feels very different from writing queries through the Jupyter interface,
because you will not have any text or guidance to draw upon to help you understand
how to interpret the database and generate a query.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Teradata exercises you will complete in
this course are designed to serve as a stepping stone between these real-life
situations and the Jupyter exercises.  It's important for you to experience writing your own queries to answer real business
questions with real business data just as you would in a company, and take the
time you need to figure out how to arrive at the correct answer, and then check
your answers after you have finalized your query.  For this reason, you will be given less guidance
in the Teradata exercises than in the Jupyter exercises.  The goal is to for you to overcome challenges
now, before you take on your first analyst job!
 </p>
 <p>
  Another
important opportunity these Teradata exercises provide is the ability to see
for yourself what working with “Big Data” feels like. Some questions have been designed so that the queries won’t
take too long to run, but as the course progresses and queries become more
complicated, you will find it may take minutes for queries to output a result.  Teradata is a very fast platform, so these
query times represent some of the fastest query times you are likely to see in
a business setting.  Take advantage of the
opportunity to get a feeling for how long different types of queries take to
implement.
 </p>
 <p>
  The best way to become truly proficient with SQL is to practice.  To motivate you to practice, the quizzes in
this course are primarily based on the answers you retrieve from queries you
write to analyze the Dillard’s dataset.
  <strong>
   <u>
    For this reason, you will not be given the
answers to the Teradata exercises.
   </u>
  </strong>
  Instead, you should use the quizzes to determine whether your queries
are correct.  Don’t worry, though!  The Teradata exercises will take you through
the steps needed to write queries that will help you answer the quiz questions.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <u>
    Save your
written queries while completing the Teradata exercises so you can use or adapt
them to answer quiz questions
   </u>
  </strong>
  (you can save the queries in your Teradata account or
copy them to a document you save on your computer).  Saving the queries gives you a portfolio to show
employers, or one you can refer to after completing this course.
 </p>
 <p>
  Plan to allot a significant amount of time to finish the quizzes each
week.  Since the quizzes are based on
writing actual queries, they take time to complete.  More complex queries also take longer to run,
so the exercises and quizzes will take longer to complete. We strongly
encourage you to use the course discussions and Stack Overflow (
  <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">
   www.stackoverflow.com
  </a>
  ) to ask questions and help other people when they
have questions as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  This course is primarily designed to help you gain the technical
skill set that will allow you to write SQL queries.  However, writing SQL queries is only one part
of your job as a data analyst.  The other
part of your job will be to know your dataset deeply enough to write queries
that give correct and meaningful answers so you and your company can make good
decisions about what actions to take. 
Real data are messy, and if you don’t pay attention to the details of
the mess, you might execute SQL queries that lead you and your company to
incorrect conclusions.  We won’t go into
depth about how to analytically or physically clean data in this course, but I
will ask you to write queries that take some of the abnormalities of the data
into account.  Doing so will make your
queries more complicated, but it is important that you learn to write queries
that address imperfections in the data. 
I encourage you to think about these exercises as an opportunity to learn
how to arrive at correct answers, more so than an opportunity to run queries
that don’t crash.

  <strong>
   <u>
    Overall Objectives for the Teradata Exercises
   </u>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Week 2:
  </strong>
  In Week 2 your
aims should be to become comfortable with the Teradata front end interface, and
the small differences in MySQL and Teradata SQL syntax.  You should also aim to get a good sense of
what information the Dillard’s data set contains, and what kind of analysis
questions the data set could help you answer.  
Finish the week knowing how to retrieve, and change the format of data
from single tables that meet specified criteria.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Week 3:
  </strong>
  In Week 3 your
aims should be to become very confident in your ability to use the main
keywords in a SQL query, and to begin appreciating how long queries take when
you are combining data from multiple tables with millions of rows.  Finish the week knowing how to summarize
data, how to segment summaries of your data, and how to combine data across
multiple tables.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Weeks 4/5:
  </strong>
  In Weeks 4 and
5, your aims should be to become comfortable translating analysis questions
into SQL queries, and confident that you can generate creative approaches to
retrieving data in formats that are different from the way they are stored in a
database.  You should also aim to gain a
deeper appreciation of how long real queries take to write and to execute.  Overall, you want to finish these weeks
feeling like a completely independent SQL analyst!
