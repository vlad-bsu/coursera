  The Teradata
exercises for this week assume that you have completed all of the MySQL
exercises, and know how to use subqueries, IF expressions, and CASE
expressions.  The quiz for this
week will build off of the exercises in this document, so although I will give
you hints to the answers, I will usually not give you the answers
explicitly.  If you can complete
all the exercises, you will do very well on the quiz.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the
exercises for this week require implementing the query syntax you learned in
previous weeks, there will not be a final quiz for this course.  This will be the final ungraded
exercise and the Week 5 quiz will be the last assessment you need to
complete.  I strongly suggest that
you save the queries you write during the exercises either in your Teradata
account or in a text file on your computer so that you can use them for
reference during the quiz.  When
noted, you might also want to save the output of the queries.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many of the
exercises you complete this week (including those required to answer quiz
questions) may take much longer to complete than those you completed last week,
due to their complexity.  You will
want to plan accordingly.  It will
likely take you several work sessions to complete these exercises.
