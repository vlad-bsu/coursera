  It is very important that you work through the Teradata exercises for this week before you attempt the graded quiz. The quiz this week requires you to write much more extensive queries than in previous weeks, and the exercises offer instructions that will guide you through questions very similar to those you will encounter in the graded quiz. As you work through the Teradata exercises, save your queries, and use the Discussions to ask your peers for help if you have questions.  You will want to use your queries, or modified versions of them, in the graded quiz.  Once you have completed the Teradata exercises, make sure to reserve a significant amount of time to complete the quiz.
