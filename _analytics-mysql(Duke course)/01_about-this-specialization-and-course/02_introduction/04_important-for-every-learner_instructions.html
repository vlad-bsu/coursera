   Auditing the Course vs. Subscription
  </u>
 </h3>
 <p>
  You can subscribe monthly to the entire specialization, including this course, or subscribe for an entire year.  Paying will give you access to all materials and you will be able to earn a certificate of completion. Read about the subscription option Coursera is offering:

  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  If you choose not to subscribe to the course, you will be able to audit the course.  Auditing allows you access to all materials, EXCEPT for the peer assessment.  You will be permitted to open the quizzes and see the material presented, but you cannot complete them, submit them, or get any feedback.

  <u>
   Access to Jupyter Notebooks
  </u>
 </h3>
 <p>
  You will have access to your Jupyter notebook for 6 months if you are actively using the notebook.  However, if you have not accessed your notebook for three continuous months, your access to the notebooks will expire.  We strongly recommend that you save your Jupyter notebooks to your local drive after you complete each MySQL exercise. This will allow you to upload your  notebooks in the event you get locked out of your Jupyter notebook, which is a result of not renewing your subscription before it expires. Once your account has expired, you will get locked out and your notebooks are then deleted.
