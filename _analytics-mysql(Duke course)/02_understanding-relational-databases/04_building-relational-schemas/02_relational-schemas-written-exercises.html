  Before you download the written exercises, please read this very important note about direction of arrows in Relational Schema.
 </p>
 <p>
  The arrow goes from the table that has a foreign key to the table where the key comes from (so the arrow points to the primary key).
 </p>
 <p>
  Try to design a database so that each table has a unified theme with a unique identifier on each row that is consistent with that theme.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whenever you have a 1:Many relationship, the relation mapped from the entity on the Many side of the relationship should get a foreign key that corresponds to the primary key of the relation on the 1 side of the relationship. This is because you would have to have duplicate values of the unique identifier of the entity on the 1 side in the table that represents the entity on the Many side.
 </p>
 <p>
  An example is the description of the database in Question 5 of the relational Schema exercise said:
 </p>
 <p>
  "Investment companies can manage multiple mutual funds. Investco Scout will not keep track of investment companies that do not manage any mutual funds. A mutual fund is managed by one investment company."
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, there is a 1:Many relationship between investment companies (1) and mutual funds (many), and there should be a foreign key in the mutual funds table that points to the primary key in the investment company table.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whenever you have a 1:1 relationship, by the way, it doesn't matter which table has the primary vs. foreign key. Whenever you have a Many:Many relationship, on the other hand, recall that you will need a separate linking table that will have two foreign keys corresponding to the primary keys of the tables that represent the entities in the Many:Many relationship.
