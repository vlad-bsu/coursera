  Question 1

  Suppose we solve a binary classification task and our solution is scores with logloss. What predictions are more preferable in terms of logloss if true labels are y_true = [0, 0, 0, 0].

    </u>
    Incorrect! Technically, the loss is infinite in this case, while is it is not for other options, so it cannot be the right answer.

  <li>
   <p hasmath="true">
    <u>
     y_pred = [0.4, 0.5, 0.5, 0.6]
    </u>
    . Incorrect! What is better to predict [0.5, 0.5] or [0.4, 0.6]? To answer this question think how $$\log$$ function behaves. If you plot it you will clearly see that  $$\log(6) - \log(5) &lt; log(5) - log(4)$$, thus $$log(4) + log(6) &lt; log(5) + log(5)$$. In fact it follows from
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%27s_inequality">
     Jensen's inequality

  Question 2

 <h2 level="2">
  Suppose we solve a regression task and we optimize MSE error. If we managed to lower down MSE loss on either train set or test set, how did we change Pearson correlation coefficient between target vector and the predictions on the same set?

 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    <u>
     Any behavior is possible.

    Yes! We cannot monotonically relate MSE and Pearson correlation similarly to how e.g. R-squared monotonically related MSE,

     The correlation did not change.

    Try to come up with a counterexample when correlation is zero, but MSE can be lowered down.

  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <u>

    No! Try to come up with a counterexample when correlation is zero, but MSE can be lowered down.

   <p>
    <u>
     The correlation became larger.

  Question 3
 </h1>
 <h2 level="2">
  What would be a best constant prediction for a following multiclass classification task with 4 classes? The number of objects of each class in train set is: 18, 3, 15, 24. Enter four comma separated values. Round each to two decimal places.

 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    <u>
     0.3,0.05,0.25,0.4
    </u>
    . To compute the best constant prediction for multi-logloss we need to divide number of objects in each class by the total size of the dataset. E.g. 18/(18 + 3 + 5 + 24)  = 0.3 .

    Yes! As it is up to a constant is equal to MSE metric.

    No! Well, maybe when the target mean is 0.5 this will work out :)

  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <u>
     Target mean divided by target variance.

    No! It's hard to justify this answer.

  <li>
   <p>
    <u>
     (Log of target mean) + 1.

    No, this option would be true if the question asked about RMSLE metric.
