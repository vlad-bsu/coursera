  Question 1

 <h2 level="2">
  Select true statements about n-grams.
 </h2>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Correct answers:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    <u>
     N-grams can help utilize local context around each word
    </u>
    . Correct, because ngrams encode sequences of words.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <u>
     N-grams features are typically sparse
    </u>
    . Correct. Ngrams deal with counts of words occurrences, and not every word can be found in a document. For example, if we count occurrences of words from an english dictionary in our everyday speech, a lot of words won't be there, and that is sparsity.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Incorrect answers:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    <u>
     N-grams always help increase significance of important words
    </u>
    . No, ngrams deals with words occurrences and not their importance.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <u>
     Levenshteining should always be applied before computing n-grams
    </u>
    . Although, there is Levenshtein distance, there is no such thing as Levenshteining.

  Question 2

 <h2 level="2">
  Select true statements.
 </h2>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Correct answers:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    <u>
     Bag of words usually produces longer vectors than Word2vec
    </u>
    . Correct! Number of features in Bag of words approach is usually equal to number of unique words, while number of features in w2v is restricted to a constant, like 300 or so.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <u>
     Semantically similar words usually have similar word2vec embeddings.
    </u>
    Correct. This is one of the main benefits of w2v in competitions.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Incorrect answers:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    <u>
     Meaning of each value in BOW matrix is unknown
    </u>
    . Incorrect. Meaning of a value in BOW matrix is the number of a word's occurrences in a document.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <u>
     You do not need bag of words features in a competition if you have word2vec features.
    </u>
    Incorrect. Both approaches are valuable and you should try to utilize both of them.

  Question 3
 </h1>
 <h2 level="2">
  Suppose in a new competition we are given a dataset of 2D medical images. We want to extract image descriptors from a hidden layer of a neural network pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. We will then use extracted descriptors to train a simple logistic regression model to classify images from our dataset.
 </h2>
 <h2 level="2">
  We consider to use two networks: ResNet-50 with imagenet accuracy of X and VGG-16 with imageNet accuracy of Y (X &lt; Y). Select true statements.
 </h2>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Correct answers:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    <u>
     It is not clear what descriptors are better on our dataset.
    </u>
    We should evaluate both. Correct! This depends on the a specific dataset and a specific task, so you should evaluate both!
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Incorrect answers:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    <u>
     With one pretrained CNN model you can get only one vector of descriptors for an image
    </u>
    . Incorrect. With one CNN you can get different descriptors from different layers.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <u>
     Descriptors from ResNet 50 will always be better than the ones from VGG-16 in our pipeline
    </u>
    . Incorrect. Although, ResNet50 shows better performance on Imagenet, this depends on the a specific dataset and a specific task.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <u>
     For any image descriptors from the last hidden layer of ResNet-50 are the same as the descriptors from the last hidden layer of VGG-16
    </u>
    . Incorrect in general. Moreover it is hard to come up with an image that will have the same descriptors in both networks.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <u>
     Descriptors from ResNet-50 and from VGG-16 are always very similar in cosine distance
    </u>
    . Incorrect. This depends on the a specific dataset and a specific task.
   </p>

  Question 4
 </h1>
 <h2 level="2">
  Data augmentation can be used at (1) train time (2) test time
 </h2>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Correct answer:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <u>
   True, True
  </u>
  . Data augmentation can be used (1) to increase the amount of training data and (2) to average predictions for one augmented sample.
