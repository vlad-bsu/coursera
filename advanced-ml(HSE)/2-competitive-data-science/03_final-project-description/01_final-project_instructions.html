  Dear all,
 </p>
 <p>
  We want to inform you, that your
  <u>
   final project
  </u>
  will be to participate in a competition. The final project is due at the end of 5th week, but we advise you to start early,  work throughout the course and try to apply material from each week.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the end of the last week you will need to submit your test set predictions to Coursera grader, that will score your solution against the private part of the test set. You will also need to write a report and submit it and your code for a peer review. We advise you to check out peer-review grading criteria right now. It is located in the last week of the course. Basically, from week to week we expect you to try main concepts that we discuss in the lectures and summarize your results in a report.
 </p>
 <p>
  The competition is hosted on Kaggle Inclass and can be found

  To start working on the final project, we now advise you to make a quick baseline and then proceed to implementing material we have discussed in this week: try several different models, preprocess and generate features for them, extract features from text. As in any other competition, your goal is to achieve the best possible quality. Good luck!
