  Welcome to the last week of the "How to Win a Data Science Competition" course! Now it's time to wrap up everything we have learned in the few past weeks.
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    We've prepared several
    <strong>
     "walk-through" videos
    </strong>
    for you. In these videos we discuss solutions to competitions we took prizes at. We will analyze the setup of the competitions, our approaches in general, and the most interesting parts of solutions in specific. The video content is quite short this week in order to let you spend more time on the final project.

    <strong>
     Final project.
    </strong>
    This one is on you. You will review and summarize what we've discussed last weeks and refine your skills by applying them to the real competition. To produce and
    <u>
     submit the final solution
    </u>
    , you will review Kaggle Winner model documentation format, and finally, you will improve your expertise by assessing solutions of other people and giving feedback in the
    <u>
     peer review
    </u>
    . We believe that analysis of approaches of others is essential step to become an expert in the competitive data science, and fortunately, you have a good opportunity here.
